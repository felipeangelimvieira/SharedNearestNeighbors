# SharedNearestNeighbors
A Shared Nearest Neighbors clustering implementation. This code is basically a wrapper of sklearn DBSCAN, implementing the neighborhood similarity as a metric.

## Examples

The implementation follows the syntax of scikit-learn clustering classes.
See example notebook for more information.

```python
from SNN import SharedNearestNeighbor as SNN
```

```python
X = np.random.rand(100,2)
snn = SNN(n_neighbors = 40,eps = 32, min_samples = 10)
y_pred = snn.fit_predict(X)
```
